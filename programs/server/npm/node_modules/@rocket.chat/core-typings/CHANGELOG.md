# @rocket.chat/core-typings

## 6.5.3

## 6.5.2

## 6.5.1

### Patch Changes

- c2b224fd82: Exceeding API calls when sending OTR messages

## 6.5.0

### Minor Changes

- c0ef13a0bf: Added `push` statistic, containing three bits. Each bit represents a boolean:
  ```
  1 1 1
  | | |
  | | +- push enabled = 0b1 = 1
  | +--- push gateway enabled = 0b10 = 2
  +----- push gateway changed = 0b100 = 4
  ```
- 92613680b7: Added option to select between two script engine options for the integrations
- ec1b2b9846: Create a deployment fingerprint to identify possible deployment changes caused by database cloning. A question to the admin will confirm if it's a regular deployment change or an intent of a new deployment and correct identification values as needed.
  The fingerprint is composed by `${siteUrl}${dbConnectionString}` and hashed via `sha256` in `base64`.
  An environment variable named `AUTO_ACCEPT_FINGERPRINT`, when set to `true`, can be used to auto-accept an expected fingerprint change as a regular deployment update.
- 5f81a0f3cb: Implemented the License library, it is used to handle the functionality like expiration date, modules, limits, etc.
  Also added a version v3 of the license, which contains an extended list of features.
  v2 is still supported, since we convert it to v3 on the fly.

- dea1fe9191: feat: Disable and annonimize visitors instead of removing
